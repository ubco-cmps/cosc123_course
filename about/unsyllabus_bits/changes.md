In this section, I will outline any changes that have been made to the unsyllabus as we go through the course.
We will do our best to follow the plan outlined in this unsyllabus, but in case things go south, I will need to make adjustments to the contents and the schedule.

Any major changes to the syllabus (this page) will be documented here, as well as the date the change was made. 

| Change Date    | Summary                               | Rationale                                                                                                                                                       |

| Feb 2, 2023 | Adjusted Schedule for Weeks 6-11 | I've decided to restructure the Arrays and Object Oriented Programming discussion and split it over longer weeks, and shrink the discussion on Variables. Also changed Test times from 50 mins to 50 mins. |
