```{warning}
Remember, there is NO grace period for the Tests. You have a 48 hour window to complete the test, but if you miss the window, your only option is to wait for the bonus test the following week.
```

There will be 5 tests in this course in an (approximately) bi-weekly schedule.
For each of the tests, there will be a bonus test exactly one week later and the better score of the Test-Bonus Test pair will be taken.

There will be 12 learning logs to be submitted, and I will count 10 of them for grades.

```{attention} 
All deadlines in this course have an automatic 48 hour grace period after the due dates listed above.
Any submissions submitted past the grace period will not be graded (with some exceptions).
