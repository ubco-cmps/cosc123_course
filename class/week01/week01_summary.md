## About this page

Each week, on the "Week X Summary" page, you will find a list of things you have to do this week, and the suggested order. 
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
Once you finish the task, check off the box so you can keep track of your progress (just a note, I will not know whether you click the checkboxes or not).

## How to watch flipped lecture videos

You should plan on scheduling time to watch these lecture videos as they will be one of the major mediums through which new content will be communicated to you.
In lecture we will practice some of the things mentioned in the videos (and to a lesser extent, the readings), but we won't be able to hit on everything.

Here is a nice video summarizing how to watch flipped lecture videos - the context is in the video is physics, but it is applicable to COSC courses as well.
