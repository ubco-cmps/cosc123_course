## How to watch flipped lecture videos

You should plan on scheduling time to watch these lecture videos as they will be one of the major mediums through which new content will be communicated to you.
In lecture we will practice some of the things mentioned in the videos (and to a lesser extent, the readings), but we won't be able to hit on everything.

Here is a nice video summarizing how to watch flipped lecture videos - the context is in the video is physics, but it is applicable to COSC courses as well.
