# Task 2 - Practice Git Commands

I will be honest: Git and GitHub is a difficult thing to teach and
after many years of searching, I have found a [really great tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org).
This tutorial wil help you get more familiar with git commands, particularly branching, and merging - things you will start encountering when you start collaboratively working in your repos.

## Specifications

You are responsible for completing the following modules:

- "Main: Introduction Sequence"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  
- "Ramping up"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4

- "Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

Once you are done, you should include a screenshot of both the exercises in "Main" and "Remotes", and also include a text file where you write your github username and the current date/time.

**You should add the screenshot to this repository.**

Here is an **example** of the screenshot we are expecting.
