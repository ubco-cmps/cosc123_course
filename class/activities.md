We are using GitHub Classroom to deliver the Lecture Activities for this course.
You will first need to create a GitHub account, and then you can accept each Lecture Activities.
Once the Lecture Activities is ready (usually activities are started during the lecture), the link wil become active, and you will be able to accept the lab in your GitHub.com account.

Once you click the link, a repository will automatically be created for you with some starter code.
You can then work on the Lecture Activities, make commits, and push them to GitHub as often as you please. 
Once the deadline and the grace period has passed, you will no longer be able to push any changes.

Remember that once you've accepted the lab, the link to your repository becomes fixed so you can submit it on Canvas at any time. We will mark the last commit before the deadline (including grace period).
