These instructions will walk you through installing the required software stack for this course. 
Before starting, ensure that your laptop meets the following requirements:

 - runs one of the following operating systems: macOS 11.x, Windows 10, and Ubuntu 20.04.
- can connect to networks via a wireless connection
- has at least 50 GB disk space available
- has at least 8 GB of RAM
- uses English as the default language (if you want TAs or the instructor to help you)
- student user has full administrative access to the computer

**Students' whose laptops do not meet the requirements specified above will not be able to receive technical assistance from the course team in troubleshooting installation issues.**

## Visual Studio Code

The open-source text editor Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is both a powerful text editor and a full-blown Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
You can download and install the macOS version of VS Code from the VS code website [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Once the download is finished, click "Open with Archive utility", and move the extracted VS Code application from "Downloads" to "Applications".

### Configure your machine to launch VS Code from the Terminal (aka command line)

1. Launch VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (â‡§âŒ˜P ; shift+command+P).
3. Type 'shell command' to find the "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" command.
4. Hit Enter
5. Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. 

You can open files in VS Code from the Terminal!
Alternatively, just type `code .` in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

You can test that VS Code is installed and can be opened from Terminal by restarting terminal and typing the following command in a Terminal:

```
code --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:

```
1.52.1
ea3859d4ba2f3e577a159bc91e3074c5d85c0523
x64
```

[Manual install instructions are here, but remember you're using the zsh now!](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) steps as well.

### VS Code extensions

The real magic of VS Code is in the extensions that let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your specific workflow. Now that we have installed all our other Data Science tools, we can install the VS Code extensions that work really well with them. From within VS Code you can open up the [Extension Marketplace (read more here)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) to browse and install extensions by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar indicated in the figure below.

To install an extension, you simply search for it in the search bar, click the extension you want, and then click "Install". 
There are extensions available to make almost any workflow or task you are interested in more efficient!
To do this, search for and install the following extensions:

- Java Extension Pack (0.12.1) by Microsoft
- Processing Language (1.4.5) by Tobiah Zarlez
- markdownlint (markdown linting and style checking extension)
- GitLens - Git supercharged (powerful extension that extends VS Code's native git capabilities)
- (Optional) Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 (add colour to help distinguish your brackets: (), [], {})

## GitHub.com

We will use the publicly available [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
You should have already created a GitHub.com account during the lectures, if you have not, you should do so ASAP.

## Configure Git on your computer

We will be using the command line version of Git as well. 
Some of the Git commands we will use are only available since Git 2.23, so if your Git is older than this version, we ask you to update it using the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git.

Open Terminal and type the following command to install Xcode command line tools:

```
xcode-select --install
```

After installation, in terminal type the following to ask for the version:

```
git --version
```

you should see something like this (does not have to be the exact same version) if you were successful:

```
git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
```

> Note: If you run into trouble, this is the time to post on Ed Discussion with your error message and ask for help!

### Configuring Git user info

Next, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email. 
To do this type the following into a new Terminal window (replacing Jane Doe and janedoe@example.com, with your name and email (the same used to sign up for GitHub), respectively):

```
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com
```

> Note: to ensure that you haven't made a typo in any of the above, you can view your global Git configurations by either opening the configuration file in a text editor (e.g. via the command `code ~/.gitconfig`) or by typing `git config --list --global`.

## Terminal

Apple recently changed the Mac default shell in the Terminal to Zsh - though the [reasons for this](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2019/06/04/why-does-macos-catalina-use-zsh-instead-of-bash-licensing/) are complicated, it is a huge improvement over the out-dated Bash version that came pre-installed on macOS.

To make sure your shell is set to Zsh, open up your Terminal and run this command:

```
chsh -s path
```

### Setting VS Code as the default editor

To make programs run from the terminal (such as `git`) use VS Code by default, we will modify `~/.z_profile`. First, open it using VS Code:

```
code ~/.z_profile
```

Paste the following lines to the new file that opens up:

```
# Set the default editor for programs launch from terminal
EDITOR="code --wait"
VISUAL=$EDITOR  # Use the same value as for "EDITOR" in the line above
```

Then save the file and exit VS Code.

> Most terminal programs will read the `EDITOR` environmental variable when determining which editor to use, but some read `VISUAL`, so we're setting both to the same value.

### [Optional] Install Ohmyzsh to get Terminal colours, and highlighting

Oh My Zsh is installed by running the following command in your Terminal: 

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You may now customize your Terminal with themes by [following the directions here]("https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#selecting-a-theme"].

## Post-installation notes

You have completed the installation instructions, well done ðŸ™Œ!
Remember to add a screenshot as instructed in your lab!
